Final Project Group Expectations

## Communication with Each Other

- What is the best form of communication in each scenario? (Call, Text, IM, E-Mail) How do we as a team want to handle each type of scenario?
    - Stuck on a problem.

-Text the other two team members in a group message.

- Cool new idea.

-Put it on our Basecamp. If want to talk about it the next day, put it on with no email notification. If it’s of high importance, add it with email notification.

- Architecture change.

-Put it on our Basecamp. If want to talk about it the next day, put it on with no email notification. If it’s of high importance, add it with email notification. No major changes without discussion.

- Someone is late for a meeting.

-Person who is late texts. People who are here texts. Thirty minutes and the late person receives a phone call.

- What is a good expectation for when you should get a reply for each? (For example, we as a team expect phone calls to be responded to within 6 hours… etc.)
    - Call - 3 hours
    - Text - 3 hours
    - IM - N/A
    - E-mail - 12 hours

## Time Commitment

- What times of day are expected to be “project hours” for all group members? In-class time to work on projects. Working until nine most evenings at MakerSquare is the expectation, and then we might each have homework after that.
- Will we be working on the project over the weekends? At least one day on the weekends, an eight-hour day together, Sunday preferable. Try to plan this ahead of time.
- Do any team members have time-exceptions they know about up front? What are they? We’ve all cleared our schedules, and if anything comes up, we’ll let each other know.
- During what time of day is expected to be at MakerSquare working together? In-class time to work on projects. Working until nine most evenings at MakerSquare is the expectation, and then we might each have homework after that.

## Conflict Resolution

- At what point do we take a conflict to instructors? (Don’t wait until it’s too late for us to help!) If we’ve already talked amongst the three of us and couldn’t resolve it.
- If we are not getting along as a team, how will we handle it? Meet with the whole group to talk about it.
- Generally, what causes stress for you? Answer for each group member. (For example, I get stressed when we’re doing too much talking vs. doing.)

Not making enough progress or feeling left out of core work. Not having good expectations. Lack of focus, lacking in the pattern of goal/meet goal.

- How does each group member display stress? Answer for each group member. (For example, I display stress by getting really quiet, or agitated easily.)

-Stop talking.

- If we feel like someone is slacking, what will we do?

-The other two will talk to them and see what the issue is.

## Teamwork



- When you recognize you need to pair, how will you indicate that to a team member?

-Bring up that you want to pair program, and ask if now is a good time or if between thirty minutes to an hour works better and pick a time.

- When you recognize it’s time for you to work individually, how will you indicate that to a team member?

-Tell the other two that you need to focus on your task for at least X amount of time.

- When we meet as a team, how will we keep track of decisions that have been made?

-Basecamp

- How often will we meet as a team?

-Once a day. Maybe not one day on the weekend. Whenever we meet, we’ll have a 10-minute meeting to focus on what we’ll be doing that day.

- How will we use Git? What’s the workflow for that? We’re all contributors on our project. We’ll use branches for features and then merge them into master.
- How will we divvy up tasks? At our meeting at the beginning of each day, we’ll discuss what we’re working on together, and what each of us is working on separately for the day.
- How will we update each other on what we’ve done or worked on?

-Basecamp. We’ll talk about it as we’re leaving for the day. Or we close a GitHub issue.

- How do we prioritize tasks? Morning meeting. MVP comes first.


## Communication with Instructors



- When daily will our 10 minute update with Osei take place?

-We could schedule it halfway through the afternoon.

- How do we plan on asynchronously keeping our instructor in the loop?

-We could invite him to our Basecamp, but not email him when we add things and set it as read-only.

- How will we reach out with questions for different instructors?

-Opening a GitHub issues or finding the instructor if we see them at MakerSquare.
